[color=#f38ba8][size=6]Reasonable Senses Configurable[/size][/color]

This mod is a successor to [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/3377]Reasonable Senses - Afterglow effects[/url].
It supports more types of objects, and is configurable.

[color=#fab387][size=5]Features[/size][/color]

You can disable witcher sense highlights for

[list]
[*]Doors
[*]Posters
[*]Clues
[*]Stashes
[*]Signposts
[*]Noticeboards
[*]Workbenches & grindstones
[*]Various types of containers

[list]
[*]Herbs
[*]Beehives (the natural ones on trees)
[*]Corpses
[*]Others
[/list][/list]
I might add support for more types of objects down the road. You can also request some in the comments. It's also quite likely I've missed some, feel free to let me know of any (with an attached save file).

[color=#fab387][size=5]Installation & usage[/size][/color]

Install with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/2678]The Witcher 3 Mod Manager[/url].
Of course, you can install manually if you wish, but I won't provide support for it.

In-game, tweak the options to your liking in the mod menu.

[color=#fab387][size=5]Compatibility[/size][/color]

Mods editing herb [font=Courier New].srt[/font] files or [font=Courier New].w2sf[/font] files will need a patch.

The few script edits not done through annotations should automerge in the vast majority of cases.

Keep the mod menu limit in mind. If you have more than 9 menus under the [font=Courier New]Mods[/font] submenu, you should use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/3650]Community Patch - Menu Strings[/url].

[color=#fab387][size=5]Known bugs[/size][/color]

[color=#f9e2af][size=4]Won't fix[/size][/color]

[list]
[*]When having [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/7167]Friendly Focus[/url]' 'Fade Transition' option off, objects set to not highlight may be highlighted for some frames on the first time focusing after a loading screen

[list]
[*]Not exactly a bug, moreso a vanilla feature revealed by this mod combo
[*]Likely caused by the lingering effect of the highlight, would likely need a particle or shader edit to fix. I tried & wasn't able to find the right file.
