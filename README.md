A successor to the Witcher 3 mod [Reasonable Senses - Afterglow effects](https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/3377).

## Changes from predecessor

- Glow for each supported type of object is configurable from a mod menu

## Usage

Install the mod as you would any other mod.
I recommend using [The Witcher 3 Mod Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/2678).

Ingame, go to Options, Mods, Reasonable Senses. Configure the options to your liking.
- ***Important note:*** If your Mods menu has over 9 menus in it, the ones later in the list don't work due to engine limitations.  
You'll need to install [Community Patch - Menu Strings](https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/3650) and edit `modReasonableSenses.xml` to put Reasonable Senses Configurable in a submenu, see description of [Menu Strings](https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/3650) for instructions.  
Reasonable Senses Configurable supports whichever submenu you pick; I pick *Visual*, myself (and plan to ship a version of the mod already under it).
